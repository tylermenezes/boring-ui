# boring-ui

Build your own design system quickly!

This library exposes some simple components you can use to build an awesome design system using React, Emotion, and
styled-system, without needing to know much about those three libraries.

Here are some things this library will do for you:

- Export the "boring" components which you can use to build the more interesting ones:
  - `Box`
  - `P`/`H`/`Text`/`Link`
- Generate a reasonable color palette given your theme color.
- Make it easy to support modern practices, like dark mode and a11y.
- Provide hooks to customize everything as needed.

## Getting Started

You can generate a simple design system with:

```bash
yarn create boring-ui my-app
```
